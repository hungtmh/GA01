# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for contributing to this project!  
Please follow the guidelines below to keep our workflow clean and consistent.

---

## 1. Branching Workflow
- Always **create a new branch** from `main` before starting a new task.
- Branch name format:
feature/short-description
fix/short-description

yaml
Sao chép mã
📌 Example:
feature/login-page
fix/navbar-bug

yaml
Sao chép mã

- After finishing your task:
- Push your branch to GitHub.
- Create a **Pull Request (PR)** to merge it into `main`.
- Delete the branch after merging to avoid clutter.

---

## 2. Pull Requests (PR)
- Every PR must be **reviewed by at least 1 team member** before merging.
- Do not merge directly into `main`.
- Test your changes carefully before opening a PR.
- Keep PRs small and focused on a single task or feature.

---

## 3. Commit Message Convention
Use the following format for commit messages:

type: short description

yaml
Sao chép mã

📌 Examples:
feat(Hung): add login page
fix(Ngoc): fix API returning 404
style(Minh): update header color
refactor(Phuc): optimize Navbar component
docs(Nam): update README

yaml
Sao chép mã

**Allowed types:**
| Type       | Meaning                                |
|------------|------------------------------------------|
| feat       | New feature                             |
| fix        | Bug fix                                 |
| docs       | Documentation updates                   |
| style      | UI or formatting changes                |
| refactor   | Code restructuring without new features |
| test       | Add or modify tests                     |
| chore      | Miscellaneous tasks (config, cleanup…)  |
